    <h2 class="about-us-h2">Our Story</h1>
    <p class="about-us-text">Touch the Dom was founded by four friends who met in college. Aina and Inno played guitar, Sonia played the piano, 
        and Felix played the handpan. The four of them formed a rock band together and played shows around town. After a few years,
         they decided to start a music school to share their love of music with others.</p>
