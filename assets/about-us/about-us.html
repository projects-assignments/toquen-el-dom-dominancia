    <h2>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Touch the Dom was founded by four friends who met in college. Felix and Ino played guitar, Sonia played keyboards, 
        and Aina played the handpan. The four of them formed a rock band together and played shows around town. After a few years,
         they decided to start a music school to share their love of music with others.</p>
